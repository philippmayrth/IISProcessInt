PMM: Pizzeria Mamma Mia

# What is the problem?

The Pizzeria is **losing revenue on some deliveries** and gets **negative ratings** from customers

Split up in two part problems:
A: Loosing revenue on some delivereis
B: Negative ratings

Note: Negative ratings is B because A influences B but B does not influence A. So solging A gives part of the solution for B.

# Why?

Why is this a problem in the first place? Include a MindMap outlining reasons and cluster realated reasons (results in fewer hypothesis later).

## Hypothesis

Formulate hyothesis about each why cluster and include all relevant evidence that lead to the decition of accept / reject so it can be retested and a decition can be understood at a later time.

Tipp: Try to formulate hypothesis in a way that they can be tested easily like "If X then Y" in this example easy boolean logic can be applied.

### ✅ / ⛔️ / ❓ Hypothesis 1

Status: Accepted / Rejected / Insufficient Evidence to Accept or Reject

Reasoning:
Why is this hypothesis accepted / rejected


Sometimes mapping the hypothesis in an argument map like this can help applying boolean logic and testing the hypothesis:

# How?

Brainstorm ideas on how to solve the problem in a mind map here.

## Hypothesis

Formulate hypothesis and cluster again but this time the hypothesis is meant to check how valuable each course of action would realy be. Eg. "Doing X is a worthwhile effort to solve this problem".


# Do

Now strategice / Plan any actions that are woth taking as outlined in the how part. And execute them.

Sometimes not all viable options can be taken at the same time use Network diagrams or Weighted Sum Analysis to make a decition on which to take.
